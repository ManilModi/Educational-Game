The Four In A Row game server is an educational Python Django-based API designed for students to develop software and robotic clients for gameplay. It provides a simple JSON-based HTTP API for interaction, supporting both web-based and robotic players. Inspired by the Battleships API, it focuses on teaching API fundamentals. The server requires Python 3.6+ and follows REST principles with versioned endpoints (api/1.0/). The stable beta was targeted for January 2024, with ongoing improvements.
